# Brief Description
Snake game is one of the most popular arcade games of all time. In this game, the main objective of the player is to catch the maximum number of foods without hitting itself. The more foods that the snake eats, the longer it'll be. If the snake hit itself, then the game will restart, and the snake will reset just like when the game started.

# Lessons learned / Reflection

I learned that creating a game isn't as easy as it looked. Sometimes when I comment about a game because it's bad, I understand now how hard it is. I also learned that I can create simple games like Hungry Snake and other games using python, which is really fun.
